In this project, I applied my Java programming skills to develop a curated collection of examples that illustrate key design patterns—Creational, Structural, and Behavioral—alongside the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. The aim was to create a practical reference that not only explains these concepts but also demonstrates their real-world application in building clean, maintainable, and extensible software.

Using Java’s strong object-oriented features, I implemented patterns such as Singleton, Factory Method, Builder, Adapter, Observer, and Strategy. Each implementation was carefully structured to align with one or more SOLID principles, ensuring that the resulting code was modular, reusable, and easy to extend. For instance, applying the Open/Closed Principle allowed classes to support new functionality without modifying existing code, while the Single Responsibility Principle ensured each class had a well-defined purpose.

To enhance clarity, I paired each example with UML diagrams that depict the relationships between classes and interfaces. This visual representation helped in mapping the abstract concepts to tangible implementations, making the learning process more intuitive. Additionally, I documented the intent, structure, and applicability of each pattern, highlighting scenarios where it would be most effective.

Throughout the work, I focused on writing code that reflects industry best practices, including consistent naming conventions, clear separation of concerns, and appropriate use of interfaces and abstract classes. I also explored how design patterns and SOLID principles complement each other to produce robust architectures capable of evolving with changing requirements.

This approach not only reinforced my understanding of advanced Java concepts but also demonstrated how thoughtful design leads to software that is easier to test, maintain, and scale. The final collection serves as both a learning resource and a practical toolkit for applying design patterns and SOLID principles in real-world Java projects.
